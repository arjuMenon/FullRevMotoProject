        <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
        <p>At FullRevMoto, we strive to ensure timely delivery of your orders. The dispatch of products will be completed within 48 hours of the purchase being submitted. Please note that dispatch may be delayed during festival holidays, public holidays, or promotional sale periods.</p>

        <h2>Order Tracking</h2>
        <p>After successfully placing an order, you will receive a unique tracking identity number once FullRevMoto hands over the product(s) to our Logistic Partner. This tracking number allows you to monitor the delivery status of your order.</p>

        <h2>Delivery Timeline</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, delivery may take 2 to 10 working days after dispatch. If your delivery experiences significant delays beyond this timeframe, please contact our customer care team for assistance.</p>

        <h2>Logistics Partners</h2>
        <p>For secure and efficient shipping, FullRevMoto works with the following logistics partners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DTDC</li>
            <li>Amazon Shipping</li>
            <li>Indian Post</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consignment door delivery depends on the service area of the chosen logistics partner. If door-to-door delivery is not available in your location, you may need to pick up your shipment from the nearest delivery hub, as advised by the logistics partner. They will contact you to confirm the arrangements.</p>

        <h2>Special Shipping Requests</h2>
        <p>If you require express delivery or international shipping, please contact our customer care department during the ordering process for assistance.</p>

        <h2>Missed Deliveries and Refunds</h2>
        <p>Should there be a need for a refund due to missed deliveries, shipping costs and payment processing fees will be deducted from the refunded amount if the customer has not responded to calls from our team or logistics partners during the delivery process.</p>

        <h2>Return Shipping</h2>
        <p>We do not offer return pick-up services. Customers must return items to the address provided on our contact page at their own cost.</p>

        <h2>Shipping Delays During Sale Periods</h2>
        <p>Please note that orders placed during sale periods may experience delays due to high order volumes. For updates related to delays, please contact our customer care team.</p>
