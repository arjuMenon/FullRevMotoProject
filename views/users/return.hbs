        <h1>Returns & Refunds</h1>
        <p>Following are the terms and conditions for returns and refunds on all products. All our returns and refunds
            are governed by the following:</p>

        <h2>Return/Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            - If a product is found faulty, has a manufacturing defect, or if a wrong product is sent, we will replace
            it as soon as possible.
            <br>- A full refund for that product will only be issued if a replacement is unavailable in stock. In all
            other cases, we will replace the product.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional Terms</h2>
        <p>
            - Any exceptions to this policy will be specified in the product description. Unless otherwise noted, all
            products adhere to the above policies.
            <br>- For refunds on shipping costs, we will only reimburse up to the amount it cost us to ship the product
            to you or the amount you paid (whichever is lower).
            <br>- Products purchased during sales or discount offers are not eligible for refunds or replacements.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancellation Charges</h2>
        <p>
            - A charge of 2.5% is applicable if you cancel your order within 24 hours.
            <br>- For Snapmint orders, cancellations other than for manufacturing defects will also incur a 2.5% charge
            on the total order value.
        </p>

        <h2>Return Process</h2>
        <p>
            - Upon receiving the product, please inspect it for damages, size issues, or manufacturing defects. Report
            any issues to our customer support at 8589020202/7591960202 within 24 hours. Returns must be sent within 10
            days.
            <br>- We recommend recording an unboxing video starting from when you receive the package without removing
            the packaging tape. This helps in case there are issues with your order and assists in faster resolution.
        </p>

        <h2>Refund Processing Time</h2>
        <p>
            - All refunds and returns will be processed within 5-10 business days from FullRevMoto. However, actual
            refund times may vary based on respective banks' processing times.
